# lxsh
Start a linux shell here.

Let's say you're on a macos machine and know that there is a command in linux you'd like to use. Let's call it `cp -a` (which copies an entire directory structure). With lxsh, you can do this:

    [johnnyappleseed@mymac mydir]$ lxsh
    root@af31dc1398c4:/Users/john/Projects/docker-tricks/lxsh# cp -a here there

And done!
